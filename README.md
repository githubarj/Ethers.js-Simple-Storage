# Ethers.js Simple Storage 
Hi!
This is a simple smart contract written in **solidity** that saves a number and one can also view it.  
It showcases the basics if solidity, import and inheritance.  
For  compiling and deployment I used **ethers.js** and **ganache** for my test environment.   
This shows how to compile a smart contract with ethers.js and deploy on local machine using ganache.  
This contract is also veridie and published on the **Rinkeby** Testnet at the adress specified in the webise section of the description.
